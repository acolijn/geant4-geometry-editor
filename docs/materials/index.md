# Materials

The Materials section of the Geant4 Geometry Editor allows you to create, manage, and assign materials to your geometry objects. Materials are essential for accurate simulation of particle interactions in Geant4.

## Overview

Materials in Geant4 define how particles interact with the geometry. The Materials section provides a comprehensive interface for creating and managing materials with properties that match those available in Geant4.

## Features

- Create and edit materials with precise physical properties
- Import predefined NIST materials
- Define custom element-based materials and compounds
- Visualize materials with distinct colors in the 3D Viewer
- Export materials in JSON format compatible with Geant4

## Material Types

The Geant4 Geometry Editor supports several types of materials:

- [NIST Materials](nist-materials.md): Standard materials from the NIST database
- [Element-Based Materials](element-based.md): Materials defined by their elemental composition
- [Compounds](compounds.md): Materials composed of other materials in specific proportions

## Material Properties

For each material, you can define various properties:

- **Basic Properties**: Name, density, state (solid, liquid, gas)
- **Physical Properties**: Temperature, pressure, refractive index
- **Composition**: Elements or materials and their proportions
- **Optical Properties**: Absorption length, scintillation yield, etc.

## Material Management

The Materials section provides tools for managing your materials:

- **Material Library**: Browse and select from predefined materials
- **Custom Materials**: Create and save your own materials
- **Import/Export**: Share materials between projects
- **Material Assignment**: Assign materials to geometry objects

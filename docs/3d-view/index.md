# 3D View

The 3D View is the main interface for visualizing and interacting with your geometry. This section provides detailed information about the different components of the 3D View and how to use them effectively.

## Overview

The 3D View consists of several key components:

1. [Geometry Tree](geometry-tree.md) - A hierarchical view of all geometry objects
2. [3D Viewer](viewer.md) - The interactive 3D visualization of your geometry
3. [Properties Tab](properties-tab.md) - Edit properties of selected geometry objects
4. [Add New Tab](add-new-tab.md) - Create new geometry objects

These components work together to provide a complete environment for creating and editing Geant4 geometries.

## Navigation

The 3D View provides several navigation controls:

- **Rotate**: Click and drag with the left mouse button
- **Pan**: Click and drag with the middle mouse button or use Shift + left mouse button
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or right mouse button drag up/down

## Selection

To select an object in the 3D View:

1. Click on the object in the 3D Viewer
2. Or click on the object in the Geometry Tree

When an object is selected, its properties will be displayed in the Properties Tab.

## Context Menu

Right-clicking on an object in the Geometry Tree or in the 3D Viewer will open a context menu with additional options:

- **Delete** - Remove the selected object
- **Duplicate** - Create a copy of the selected object
- **Add to Assembly** - Add the selected object to an existing assembly
- **Export Object** - Export the selected object and its children as a JSON file

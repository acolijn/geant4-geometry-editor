# Geant4 Geometry Editor

A web-based visual editor for creating and modifying Geant4 detector geometries. This tool allows you to create complex 3D geometries through an intuitive interface and export them to JSON format for use in Geant4 simulations.

## Overview

The Geant4 Geometry Editor provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing detector geometries for Geant4 simulations. It allows you to:

- Create and modify 3D geometries visually
- Define and customize materials
- Export geometries in various JSON formats
- Save and load your work
- Interface with the geant4-simulations package
